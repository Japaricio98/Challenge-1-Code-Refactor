# Challenge-1-Code-Refactor


## Description

A marketing agency has hired me to refactor an exisiting site to make it more accessible. Some of these enhancements include:

- introduction of ```alt``` tags associated with images for vision impairment needs
- converted non-semantic HTML tags to semantic, increasing readability
- consolidated and re-organized CSS selectors for long-term sustainability


## Requirements

The business requirements asked for by the agency includes the following:

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
- WHEN I view the source code
  THEN I find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
  THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling
  and positioning
- WHEN I view the image elements
  THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes
  THEN they fall in sequential order
- WHEN I view the title element
  THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
